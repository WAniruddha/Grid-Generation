# Grid-Generation

This is a Report on Grid generation techniques for modern CFD problems. 
It uses an open source Automotive model - DriAver Fastback
The learning include 
1. Geometry Cleanup
2. Preprocessing like Naming conventions, Creating external volumes and so on.
3. Meshing using 2 commercial Meshing packages namely ANSYS Fluent Meshing and Fidelity Pointwise. The report gives a detailed comparison for the meshing upproaches. It highlights the good capabilities and also the issues a user might face while doing so.
4. Throughout this meshing process, care was taken to ensure Mesh Quality metrices are checked continuously to obtain a good quality mesh whoch can be used directly for a CFD simulation as per requirement.

The report was graded 77/100 for the Module 3-Grid Generation from the MSc CFD Course Cranfield University 2025.
Note the mesh files are very large and hence not attached in the repositry. Incase of any requirements, kindly reach out to me as I am willing to take this prject forward.
